# SQL-Data-Cleaning-Project

This is a simple data cleaning and processing project, using Our World in Data's covid data extracted on September 3rd, 2023.

Source: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv

The data is simplified first using excel to sped up the load process by dropping some redundant columns. More info on the selection should be obvious by the script.

The processing is meant as a prerequisite for visualization project in the near future.
